_Towards a general theory of communication_


Claude Shannon's vision was clear, and incomplete.

In a 1948 paper, A mathematical theory of communication (which I have not read), Shannon clearly defined the boundaries and central precepts of a mathematical form of communication, the fundamental principles of the transfer of a message from source14 to destination15:
writing live:


In this theory, individual conceptual objects of meaning - symbols - units of information and fragments of other informational or conceptual entities - bits, discrete in the virtual space, can be transferred or sent and received, perceived and interpreted. Its simplicity was surpassed only by its brilliance: largely due to the accuracy of Shannon's descriptions of this phenomenon, information technologies have exploded in sophistication, utility and use across the world. For our purposes, this primarily refers to networked computing - I'm not aware of the implications of Shannon's theories for the advancement of the computer's internal capabilities, though I imagine they are similarly profound.
This mathematical theory, which ultimately describes how to convey information encoded in the most simplistic system of symbology imaginable: a one dimensional sequence of conceptual voids that could be occupied by one of two states: something, or nothing. One or zero. Absence, presence.
 " lies behind any phenomenon involving data encoding and transmission" (Floridi 2010).


By describing the measurement and communication of units of information, Shannon established what was necessary to understand encoded signals and how to transmit messages on a channel. By Shannon's definition, a message consists of a sequence of symbols - Shannon information (Floridi 2010 pp 38). "If base 2 is used, the resulting units may be called binary digits, or more briefly bits, a word suggested by J. W. Tukey" (Shannon 1948 pp 380). 
Looking beyond the intense usefulness of Shannon's theories, I wonder what we might find if we considered Shannon's definition of "message" to fail to describe the complete picture. Importantly, this is not to discredit the brilliance and profound impact Shannon's work has had on the world by applying a rigorous conceptual framework to the mathematical treatment of binary information, but to build on it, and plant seeds that may grow into a coherent worldview.


In the Conclusion and Appendix 7 the 
What are the limits to this theory of digital communication?  What if we accepted a definition of "message" broader than Shannon's?


Communication as information transfer
Passive vs active - intended vs not
Key concepts
Message. Meaning. 
Signal. Matter. 
Channel. Ether. 
Informer. Sender. 
Informed. Receiver

Heterogeneous physical universe 
Data - at rest and in transit. "Variation" or a lack of uniformity. 
Information - meaning in data. 
Points on awareness - minds, arising from matter
With minds manifested a parallel, second layer - conceptual reality - the layer of meaning
Minds perceive meaning. In fact, meaning only manifests within a mind. 
Information -> mind. Data -> brain. 


Words are identifiers for concepts 
Scope of identification / namespace. Local vs global. 


Why it matters
Our worldview informs how we understand the patterns of reality
The materialist worldview is falling dreadfully short
We need to upgrade our understanding
Acknowledging the existence of these two facets of reality - physical and conceptual - means we can have more accurate conversations. 
The characteristics or qualities of conceptual objects
