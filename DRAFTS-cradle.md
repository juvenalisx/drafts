# Systems for a secure cradle 

A pivotal moment in history. 

Perhaps the pivotal moment in history. 

System is more interconnected than ever.

For most, meaningful communication is all but instantaneous.

We have inherited this system, its state evolving over time, an unbroken chain back to the origin of time (if that exists)g

Within it - on Earth - matter formed life and life became us. We became conscious - aware of the effects of our actions to a novel extent.

- Chaotic attractor?
- Tipping point - inevitably will establish a new homeostasis. The questions: how do we plan and prepare for that, and how to we make the transition as graceful as possible.

We stand at a precipice. This has been said before - but this time it is actually true. The next 40 years will decide the fate of the human race - of life on Earth - like no century, or even millennium, before. Our actions now, conscious or otherwise, are piling up like so many twigs to form the foundation on which will rest the institutions that govern an interplanetary species. 

Aware of this, I wonder: what is our outlook? What are the risks - and where are the greatest opportunities to shore up critical structures so they form to protect and promote human dignity, and the enduring sustainability of our existence? These questions consume me, serve as the pole orienting the compass by which I guide myself. I understand that for each person, the answer will be different, unique to their perspective and worldview. For me, it rests on a few crucial activities we need to design out of our collective patterns of behavior. 

The first is, of course, the unsustainable treatment of our planet. We cannot fault those who came before, required to survive in whatever manner they saw fit, bound by the reality of a scarcity of the physical resources required to sustain themselves. Yet it seems to me that we are inheriting the construct of scarcity, even as its reality fades. On Earth, physical resources are abundant. On Earth, we produce enough to provide every human with the the base layers of their hierarchy of needs. There is room for everyone to exist, to sleep - water for them to drink (or ways of sustainably producing or transporting potable water) - food for them to eat - air for them to breathe. The silos that have emerged in our complex economic system prevent these resources meeting those in need - our markets our inefficient (for what is a market meant for if not to provide those in need access to what they lack?) - but the resources are there. We have achieved the capability for everyone to shift focus on to their belonging needs, and to self actualization. (This is possible because many humans will fulfill their belonging needs by producing the physical resources needed for everyone to fulfill their scarcity needs.) Now we must exercise that capability, while we grasp that if we do not do so in a way that is compatible with the thriving existence of our grandchildrens' grandchildren, we fail in our practice.

There are so many complex and wicked problems to achieving a sustainable existence globally, fortunately matched by legions of intelligent, driven (if underresourced) humans (and other agents) working to uncover their solutions, and implement them. 

My limited understanding of these systems and my motivation to effect maximum impact, to leverage my actions towards our shared goal of creating a world that can exist in balance interminably, draws me to what I recognize as our collective central nervous system: the global financial system. By thoughtfully exerting pressure on this system, we can create the conditions where the rational course of action - which includes, for some agents in the system, maximizing the delivery of monetary value to shareholders - is to preserve, improve and promote the health of our environment and all within it. 

Additionally, I am realizing the limitations of a system in which nation states are the sovereign authority. It is becoming clear that this is not, in fact, reflected in the organizations - and even individuals - that have actual power. Many corporations control more resources, and have more territory, than most countries. (Of course they occupy a different role, with different rights, in our systems of governance, but the comparison is still interesting.) Some people have more money at their disposal than ____. Without a global governance system for people, organizations, and software agents, we (as in our tax havens) seem to be in a race to the bottom, a free fall to attract capital through a permissive regulatory environment. (Though to be fair I have heard Steve Jobs did love Dublin.) Our pace is accelerated by the fact that the power of the frontrunners to further remove legal barriers to antisocial behavior (especially financially) is influenced by the very individuals engaging in that behavior - many of the institutions of governance are captured by special interests. 

The time for a global governance system is past due, but it has not been achieved because we are using systems of government designed to administer local territories. When the UN was formed, Alan Turing was still alive and Claude Shannon had not yet published *A Mathematical Theory of Communication*. The United Nations' founding documents were crafted by brilliant people who understood the way things worked - but had no idea how they would work, how as the noosphere matured and our ability to exchange sophisticated messages with anyone on or near Earth in an instant emerged, our ability to coordinate would also proportionately expand.
