Prerequisites for Ricardian treaties?

Probabilistic and / or trusted (objective) oracles

Resilient decentralized identity

Proper understanding by policy makers and treaty monitors / enforcers 

Treaties are agreements between sovereign states and international organizations.

They enable these entities to coordinate in their affairs and improve their capacity to fulfill their responsibility to ensure the security and improve the welfare of their constituent people. 

Consensus networks are networks of computing nodes coordinating to agree on the state of a distributed ledger.

Smart contracts are scripts stored in the ledger and executed as part of the transaction validation process.

Participants in consensus networks are often "self-sovereign" meaning they control their accounts independent of any other actor. This is possible because they create and retain custody of the private keys that allow them to authenticate themselves when invoking smart contracts, requesting computation be performed and ledger state be updated. 

Healthy and properly decentralized consensus networks show high levels of data integrity and availability, and correctness guarantees in the execution of smart contracts. 

Smart contracts have the ability to hold and transfer funds and other assets based on conditional logic. 

Sophisticated mechanisms for ensuring the privacy and security of contracts and inputs are evolving, including Aztec dark contracts, Oasis enclave validator nodes, and private / permissioned distributed ledgers like Hyperledger, Corda and Quorum. 

Crucially: consensus networks are connected to the Internet. They are globally accessible and supercede geographic jurisdiction. [ In fact, consensus networks and blockchains are most useful when users need a shared data store, but don't fully trust each other.  WHY BLOCKCHAIN? Because sovereign nations don't trust each other.  ]

A smart contract is a script stored on a blockchain maintained by a consensus network, executed in the network's virtual machine. 

The evolving nature of our reality and our conception of it demands us to take a creative view (on ? what is possible? on the world?). This applies especially to our definition of what constitutes a valid "party" to a Ricardian treaty. In customary international law, treaties are signed by parties, which are sovereign states, international organizations, or, sometimes, 

In this early understanding, I believe as broad a range of agents should be considered to be valid parties to a Ricardian treaty, provided that one of them is a government organization. (One could argue that two sovereign states or international organizations must be involved, or else it would not deserve the title of "treaty" - my overarching interest is in understanding the potential of Ricardian governance, and prefer not to get bogged down in semantics.)

The key point is that a Ricardian treaty most usually will be entered into with a state. It might involve international organizations, DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations), corporate entities, non-profits, or even individual humans or machines. The treaty will provide a prose, legally interprable document that is ratified or accepted (?) by the appropriate mechanism for its parties. The prose document will explicitly assign responsibility to a smart contract (or smart contracts) deployed on one or more consensus networks to store and process information provided to the contract address. Because smart contracts can conditionally transfer funds and information [ confirm that smart contracts can trigger re-encryption ], incentives of this nature can be provisioned based on contract input parameters. When applied to issues of international relations, an opportunity seems to appear.

Web3 technologies are enabling a new frontier in international law, by which states and other legal entities can enter into objectively binding and unbreakable agreements.

Environmental monitoring

The good health of the Earth is necessary for our ability to thrive. We survive because the local environmental conditions to our bodies stay within a range we can tolerate - if we are too hot or too cold or too dry or too wet for too long, we will die. This is true of every living object (organic or synthetic - if life is 'the maintenance of a chemical and electrical gradient', computers are alive).

We are aware of this, but much of our behavior continues to run counter to this truth. We are degrading the environment in an intolerable way. "No one wants to fuck the world over - they just get paid to do so."

It seems sensible, then, to consider how Ricardian governance might help us to re-align these misincentives (malincentives?) to promote the preservation and restoration of the natural health of our biosphere. 

We do have a clear understanding of many of the ways this health is degrading, just as how to preserve it. Our atmosphere, water and landforms are always changing, but if we continue the trend of changing their composition locally and globally, it is likely that the capacity of the Earth to sustain human life will soon diminish rapidly.

What if we tied very clear incentives to behavior that promotes environmental health? With Ricardian treaties and existing and emerging earth observation technologies, we have a robust and improving way for monitoring local and global environmental health.

These incentives could be applied an any level, from the individual person or synthetic agent (like a vehicle or appliance) to states and multi-national parties - even global institutions or yet un-imagined organizational entities.

On a personal level: "“We can create smart contracts between a smallholder farmer and a funder where the payment is unlocked if the tree is still there.” A farmer might be paid to keep a tree alive, or perhaps more appropriately, to manage the health of a forest or some land area. This could be measured using a diverse multitude of objective (and perhaps subjective) measurement and assessment techniques. It could be as simple as measuring summertime canopy cover of a fixed area to more sophisticated multispectral SAR and drone-captured imagery. 

On an organizational or project level, It could mean using a network of trained human analysts to provide their expert assessments based on inspection of evidence. Or  the application of machine learning algorithms trained to recognize measures of environmental well-being from a variety of inputs such as terrestrial and ...[] Connected sensors monitoring air quality could submit their empirical measurements (ideally digitally signed in on-device secure enclaves) to smart contracts that analyze the area covered by the network. If a target threshold was met, money could be transferred to those who played a role in meeting the target. This money could be transferred to the relevant city government, national environmental agency - or even to individual households with low or reduced emissions. 

On a national and super-national level, countries and multinational organizations could likewise be paid if climate targets are met. This data-driven incentivization regime could - if properly designed - create the conditions for the most rapid and least disruptive transition to a sustainable global demos and mechanos. We might even decide to *pay ourselves in the future* if we meet certain goals. Consideration of how programmable incentivization  conditional on information input from environmental monitoring devices could support our efforts to ... A financial system based on an interconnected constellation of government-issued digital currencies is fertile ground for experimentation with green finance initiatives contingent on spatial data analytics.

Transport and logistics

As global inter-reliance in our transport and logistics systems and supply supply chain builds, so does the need for a strong system for governing this global activity. Vehicles are quite unique as objects: they are designed to move between sovereign jurisdictions

Financial Activity

If Mark Carney's "synthetic hegemonic [digital] currency" comes to pass, states issuing central bank digital currencies have an opportunity to build international financial regulation and oversight mechanisms into the consensus protocols 

Tax havens *could* become a relic of a time when information traveled inscribed on paper, rather than light. Illicit actors take advantage of the complexities of living on a world with fragmented sovereignty - even a single permissive jurisdiction can provide a hiding place for all manner of ill-gotten capital. However, with our increasingly interconnected world, an algorithmic form of global governance is becoming possible. If fiat digital currencies included in this synthetic hegemonic currency adhere to a protocol which enables an all-seeing eye to gaze upon the world's financial activity, identifying corrupt actors could be simple. I am a proponent of respecting the individual's right to privacy while taking action to ensure pro-social behavior, and urge policymakers and system designers to err towards benevolent and privacy-preserving surveillance technologies. If designed properly, only those suspected of illegal behavior would find their right to privacy waived while proper authorities investigate. If no law breaking is found, privacy could be reinstated. 

Achieving these gains would require unprecedented agreement by the key players in the global financial system - more significant than the Bretton Woods agreement - but could stamp out the large-scale corruption, organized crime and money laundering that is fueling much of the human conflict in the world. 

Beyond identifying money launderers and criminals, an interlocking constellation of fiat digital currencies governed by Ricardian treaties would enable the application of instant and hyper-targeted sanctions. The Magnitsky Act enabled the sanctioning of individuals

Forms of informational incentivization

The need for self-sovereign digital identity

Naturally this entire thought experiment is built on the assumption of a robust system of identifying individuals and the effects of their actions. This assumption seems plausible given developing interest in the adoption of central bank digital currencies, along with existing personal and organizational identity systems administered by governments. Any self sovereign system will need to solve the challenge of private key management in a way that preserves individual autonomy and leaves room for mistakes - imagining a community where this is solved, I see great potential to pay people to behave in pro-social and pro-environmental ways. 

Addressing the GIGO problem

A very right criticism of smart contracts - and any computer program - has to do with the conceptual integrity of the input parameters. Objectively, inputs can be formed as data structures that the algorithm will accept - programs can be written such that data must strongly adhere to prescribed types - and most (if not all?) smart contract scripting languages are strongly typed. 

The program cannot recognize, however, if the data passed in accurately represents what it is intended to represent. This is what I mean by conceptual integrity: the extent to which a measurement accurately reflects the reality it purports to measure. If it does not, it is garbage - and if you pass garbage into a smart contract method, you are very likely to get garbage out. This can have dire consequences when getting garbage out means money is irreversibly transferred to an unknown entity's control.

For this reason, smart contract design deserves extremely careful consideration.

- Probabilistic smart contract inputs from a diverse
- A public registry of the algorithms and training datasets (whenever ethical and legal) used to train derive insights / information from raw sensor data.
- Especially early on, very low thresholds of discrepancy for requiring human intervention and review. i.e. a cautious transition to Ricardian governance

Reversibility?

At least for early iterations, it seems that some capability to reverse transactions is critical. The conditions under which a reversal of a valid transaction is justified must be very deeply considered and agreed prior to the signing and adoption / deployment of a Ricardian treaty. It would undermine the benefits to be gained by these arrangements if reversal could be executed unilaterally, though there may be situations where this is warranted. Because of this, as a principle a multisignature agreement amongst key parties to the treaty should be required to reverse any transaction. Ricardian treaties will most likely be exceptionally well-suited to situations where monitoring interaction or condition with high throughput is helpful. This might mean financial transactions, monitoring environmental data feeds, tracking the transport of goods and people (especially, obviously, across international borders) and the governance of space and spacecraft. This notion of "high throughput" fits with a sixth principle: minimize scale.

Minimize scale: the value of microtreaties

An antifragile system will adapt to defects before they manifest to the extent that they threaten the health of the system. Ricardian treaty regimes will always have defects. It is imperative, therefore, that faults be discovered and addressed early and often. For this reason, I believe it may be more appropriate to imagine Ricardian microtreaties, or perhaps streaming Ricardian treaties. 

Such treaties would have small scale
